            The database was initiated by collecting all perovskite device data up to
            the end of February 2020. Our vision is that the perovskite community should
            embrace this as a valuable resource and start to upload also new data so that
            we can stay up to date and build what we can think of as the Wikipedia of perovskite
            science.
        </p>

        <p>
            We thus encourage anyone to upload new device data.
            Ideally, we would like to have data for every device ever made,
            regardless if it is a highly efficient or a failed device, but some
            data is much better than no data.

            To upload new data to the database, the data must be formatted consistently with respect to the data already
            in the database. The backend for inserting data to the database consists of an Excel template defining all categories
            found in the database together with formatting guidelines. The latest version of the data extraction protocol can be
            downloaded here. Instructions for how to fill in the template are found in the template. The instructions are also
            available as a separate file that can be downloaded below.

            To upload data entered in the data template,
            you go the data upload app hosted by DeepVerse.
        </p>

        <p>The app is found under “Insights >> Perovskite Database Project” in the left side menu in DeepVerse’s system found on the link below (see instructions <a href="Interactive_graphics">here</a> on how to obtain access to the interactive graphics)</p>

    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Uploading new data will take some time and effort. That is unavoidable, but there are several good reasons to why it is worth that effort.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This project demonstrates the power of aggregated datasets adhering to the FAIR data principles, and that alone should provide an incentive to contribute.</li>
            <li>Sharing data in this way gives it new life and draws additional attention to the original publication</li>
            <li>Sharing data in this way is a way to comply with the demands for openness more frequently seen from taxpayers, funding agencies, and publishers.</li>
            <li>Uploading as much data as possible, both for good and bad devices, is a service to the community which helps to accelerate the development of new solar cell technology.</li>
            <li>Finally, by planning for sharing data already from the start of a project, the tools and protocols provided here can help in organising and improving local data management and thereby in the end simplify planning, analysis, and writing.</li>
