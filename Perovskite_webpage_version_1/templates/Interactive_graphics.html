        <p>To facilitate easy exploration of the perovskite data we have developed a set of interactive graphics tools. Those enable simple interactive exploration of the data in the database. The interactive graphics are hosted by Materials Zone and are reached on the link below. To reach the graphics you will need to create a free account. </p>
        <p>Figures generated by the interactive graphics are free to be used in any way.</p>

        <p><strong>General development</strong></p>
        <p>Focuses on the development of general device performance and enables filtering within the entire dataset</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Record evolution</strong></p>
        <p>Sorts out the record cells given any number of specified constraints, e.g. for transparent cells, or inverted cells, or cells based on CsPbI<sub>3</sub>, or cells fulfilling any combination of constraints.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Band gap analysis</strong></p>
        <p>Focusing on comparing device metrics as a function of perovskite band gap</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Scaling</strong></p>
        <p>Specifically focusing on illustrating the development in device scaling</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Modules</strong></p>
        <p>Focusing on perovskite modules</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Stability</strong></p>
        <p>Enables filtering and visualisation of all devices with reported stability data</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Outdoor testing</strong></p>
        <p>Enables filtering and visualisation of all devices with data from outdoor measurements. This is still a rather limited dataset, but we expect more of this in the future</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Downloading data</strong></p>
        <p>Enables downloading entier the entire dataset or any possible subset thereof</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Uploading data</strong></p>
        <p>For uploading new data to the database</p>
