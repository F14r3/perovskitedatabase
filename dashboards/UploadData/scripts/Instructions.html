<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<p>This app is used for uploading data for single junction perovskite solar cells to the database.</p>
<p>Upload data in the form of an excel file (.xlsx) formatted according to the data extraction protocol that can be downloaded from the webpage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this file is submitted for data upload, the script will look for a sheet named <strong>Master</strong> and will ignore all other sheets</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The row names in the data template is used as the keys to the data while reading in and processing the data. Do not change them. Changing the name of a row (or the spelling), make that row invisible while the data is written to the database as row names are used as data keys.</p>
<p>Removing a row (because you never use it) is ok. Default values will be inserted automatically. Adding an extra row (to capture more parameters) is ok, but that data will be ignored when data is written to the data base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Concerning data for tandem cells</strong></p>
<p>This data template is made for single junction cells. If you have data for tandem cells, there is a separate template for that.</p>
